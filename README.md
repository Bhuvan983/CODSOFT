A repository for my Data Science internship tasks provided by CodSoft
The tasks I have completed are:
1.  TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION:
- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
- The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
